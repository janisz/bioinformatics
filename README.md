# Bioinformatics
Code for bioinformatics course

1. Create the function that extracts cartesian coordinates of atoms from PDB file and calculates the distances between all CA atoms in the protein structure. [Code](coordinates.r)
2. Create an application that will take as an input two DNA sequences (verification!) Based on their lengths it will calculate their global or semiglobal alignment. [Code](psa.r)
3. Implement program in R that will: [Code](clustering.r)

  * calculate correlation between provided data (matrix); choose the least correlated data
  * perform PCA on chosen data; distinguish data with the highest variance
  * Apply K-means clustering algorithm to the chosen data with the highest variance
  
4. Implement in R either Malthus or Predator-Prey model [Code](malthus.r)
